# CP386 Assignment 4

## Makefile
The makefile provided is used to compile both Question1.c and Question2.c.

To use the makefile: 
1. Add it to the same directory where Question1.c and Question2.c are located.
2. Run the command _make_ (This will compile both Question1.c and Question2.c into executables Question1 and Question2, respectively).
3. To run the executable for Question1 do _make runq1_, this will cause the Question1 program to run with the given input value 10 5 7 8.
4. To run the executable for Question2 do _make runq2_, this will cause the Question2 program to run with the given input value 1000000.
5. Finally, perform _make clean_ to clear the directory of the Question1 and Question2 executables so only the original files before the _make_ will be present.

NOTE: make sure that the file _sample4_in.txt_ is present in the same directory as Question1 as the file is necassary for the program to run.
